# Composite-Pattern-for-a-File-System
A complete UI-based implementation of the Composite Pattern for a File System using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

  - Files are leaves ‚Äî they don‚Äôt contain other items.
  - Folders are composites ‚Äî they can contain files or other folders.
  - The display() method is implemented in both, allowing uniform treatment.


What It Does -

  - Displays a tree-like structure of folders and files.
  - Uses indentation and icons to visually separate folders üìÅ and files üìÑ.
  - Implements the Composite Pattern in JavaScript to treat folders and files uniformly.

  * Base clase: FileSystemItem:
      - a base class for both files and folders
  * Leaf Class: File
      - It inherits from FileSystemItem
  * Composite Class: Folder:
      - Folder is a container that can hold files or other folders
      - It also inherits from FileSystemItem.
      - children is an array that stores its contents
      - add() adds a file/folder and remove() removes one.
      - display() prints the folder name and then calls display() on each child with more indentation.
  * Creating the Structure:
      - create folders: root, src, and assets.
      - create files: index.js, style.css, and logo.png.
  * Building the Tree:

  * Displaying the Structure:
      - prints the entire file system starting from the root folder.
      - It recursively prints all folders and files with indentation.
