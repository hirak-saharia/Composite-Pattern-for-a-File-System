# Composite-Pattern-for-a-File-System
A complete UI-based implementation of the Composite Pattern for a File System using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

  - Files are leaves — they don’t contain other items.
  - Folders are composites — they can contain files or other folders.
  - The display() method is implemented in both, allowing uniform treatment.


What It Does

  - Displays a tree-like structure of folders and files.
  - Uses indentation and icons to visually separate folders 📁 and files 📄.
  - Implements the Composite Pattern in JavaScript to treat folders and files uniformly.
